📣 Homie 3.0 Ping example for ESP8266 and ESP32.

This is a simple example using Homie to demopnstrate Ping: 
You are able to send a Homie 3.0 compatible ping-request to the controller and it
will answer with message 'pong'.

The controller sends in addition  in loop a still-alive-message 'hello'.

# Usage

If the sketch is deployed you will get the ID of the ESP for the HOMIE-messages. Something like:

```
💡 Booting into normal mode 
{} Stored configuration
  • Hardware device ID: [deviceID]
  • Device ID: [deviceID]
  • Name: Ping
  • Device Stats Interval: 60 sec
  • Wi-Fi:
    ◦ SSID: *****
    ◦ Password not shown
  • MQTT:
    ◦ Host: *****
    ◦ Port: 1883
    ◦ Base topic: homie/
    ◦ Auth? no
  • OTA:
    ◦ Enabled? yes
```

* Open now your MQTT-Client
* Now you are able to send any String to MQTT-topic `homie/[deviceID]/ping/ping/set` 
* You will receive `pong` message as reply on topic `homie/[deviceID]/ping/ping`.

In addition every 60 sec you will get the alive message on topic `homie/[deviceID]/ping/ping` with message `hello`.
